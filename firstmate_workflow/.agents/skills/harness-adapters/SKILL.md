# harness-adapters

Use this reference before any harness-specific firstmate operation: spawn, recovery, trust-dialog handling, skill invocation, interrupt, exit, resume, or adapter verification.

Crewmates default to the same harness firstmate is running on unless `config/crew-harness` records an adapter name.
`default` means mirror firstmate's own harness.
A per-task captain instruction overrides it for that dispatch only.

`claude` is the only verified adapter.

Each adapter splits into mechanics and knowledge.
The per-task mechanics, including launch command, autonomy flag, and any enabled crewmate turn-end hook, live in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`.
The primary-session "no turn ends blind" guard contract and harness hook installation paths live in `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
The primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered from `docs/supervision-protocols/` by `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`.
The supervision knowledge lives here: busy state, exit command, interrupt, dialogs, resume behavior, skill invocation, and quirks.
Each adapter's `Busy state` row names only which semantic source that harness uses; `bin/fm-busy-lib.sh` owns the contract itself, including verdicts, source attribution, and the verification gates that keep an unverified harness at unknown.

Never dispatch a crewmate on an unverified adapter.
If `config/crew-harness` names an unverified adapter, tell the captain under `AGENTS.md` section 9 that the requested worker runtime is not verified yet, use `claude` for current work, and ask only whether to verify the requested runtime before future use.
Do not pause current work for that future-verification choice, and never launch an unverified adapter.
If the captain asks for a new harness, propose verifying it first: spawn a trivial supervised task using `fm-spawn`'s raw-launch-command escape hatch, confirm every fact empirically, then record the mechanics in `fm-spawn`, its semantic busy source and trust gate in `bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`, any needed `FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE` empty-composer override plus any novel bare agent prompt glyph in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`'s shared composer classifier (the one fleet-wide owner of the empty/dead-shell/pending decision, so a new harness's own idle composer is not misread as a dead shell), the tmux agent-process liveness classification in `bin/backends/tmux.sh`, and the verified knowledge here.

## Detection

`bin/fm-harness.sh` prints firstmate's own harness, using the verified env marker first and then process ancestry.
`bin/fm-harness.sh crew` resolves the effective crewmate harness from `config/crew-harness` (absent or `default` -> own).
`bin/fm-spawn.sh` re-resolves it on every spawn, so the choice is durable across respawns; an explicit per-spawn harness arg overrides it.
On `unknown`, ask the captain instead of guessing.
A captain override always beats detection.
When verifying a new adapter, record its env marker and command name in `bin/fm-harness.sh`.

For stuck recovery, the target window's harness is recorded as `harness=` in `state/<id>.meta`.
Use that value for interrupt, exit, resume, and skill-invocation facts.

## Primary turn-end guard

`claude` has an empirically validated hook path for the "no turn ends blind" guard: it blocks directly through a Stop hook that preserves exit status 2 and stderr from `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
The exact hook files, commands, scoping rules, and fail-open tradeoffs are owned by `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Turn-end guard" owns active validation evidence.
When changing any primary turn-end hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project or throwaway home before trusting it, then update that doc and the relevant concise fact below.

## Primary pre-arm (PreToolUse) seatbelt

`claude` has a wired PreToolUse hook that denies a watcher-arm anti-pattern (shell `&`, truncating pipe, bundling, broad `pkill -f fm-watch`) before it runs.
The exact hook files, commands, output-shaping quirks (Claude Code only honors the deny when stdout is empty), and validation transcripts are owned by `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`.
When changing any watcher-arm PreToolUse hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project before trusting it, then update that doc.
## Primary delegation-shape guard

Claude exposes built-in delegation, scheduling, and worktree tools that a primary session can use to create work with no `state/<id>.meta`, which makes the whole guard stack inert because every guard counts that metadata.
The shipped mechanism is `bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh`, a primary-home PreToolUse guard that denies a delegation-SHAPED tool name.
Claude primaries should also use an untracked per-home local `permissions.deny` list as hardening for known Claude delegation tools, because it removes them from the model's schema so they are never offered.
That deny list must not ship in tracked `.claude/settings.json` because it is Claude-only rather than harness-agnostic, and because tracked project settings propagate into linked worktrees where they disarm legitimate crewmates.
`docs/subagent-guard.md` owns the full contract, the local deny-list recommendation, the `FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1` escape hatch, and the per-harness applicability review.

Two verified facts worth pinning here.
The subagent tool presents to the model as `Agent`, and on Claude Code 2.1.217 both `Agent` and `Task` work as `permissions.deny` keys, verified by an A/B with a nonsense-name control.
`permissions.allow` is a pre-approval list rather than an availability list, so there is no fail-closed positive allowlist.

## Primary session-start nudge

AGENTS.md section 3 remains the behavioral owner for session start, while tracked native adapters invoke `bin/fm-sessionstart-nudge.sh` as an idempotent enforcement layer.
The wrapper prints one canonically typed `session-start` instruction to run `bin/fm-session-start.sh`; it never runs the digest, wake drain, bootstrap sweeps, lock, or supervision arm itself.
Full mechanics, scoping, and fail-open behavior live in `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md`.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Native session-start delivery" owns active dated commands, payloads, and evidence.

- `claude`: verified native `SessionStart` stdout injection; `.claude/settings.json` matches `startup`, `resume`, and `clear`, but not `compact`.

## Primary watcher supervision

At session start, `bin/fm-session-start.sh` prints exactly one watcher supervision block for the detected primary harness.
Do not substitute another wait shape when resuming supervision.
Claude's Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns tokenless re-arm around `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
When changing the primary watcher adapter, update `docs/supervision-protocols/`, `docs/turnend-guard.md` if a shared idle or turn-end hook changed, and the relevant concise fact below.

## Launch profile axes

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` accepts concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` values chosen by firstmate at intake.
Do not make the shell scripts parse or match natural-language dispatch rules.

Effort precedence is an explicit per-task captain instruction first, then the standing `config/crew-effort` floor, then the generic fallback below.
Never replace an effort value supplied by either higher-precedence source.
Use the fallback only when neither the captain nor applicable standing configuration specifies effort.
Use `low` for well-understood work with an explicit bounded path and `xhigh` for ambiguous investigation or design.
Choose intermediate levels proportionally as complexity, uncertainty, blast radius, or open-ended reasoning increases.
When a verified adapter lacks `xhigh`, cap the choice at its highest supported non-`max` level rather than omitting the intended effort silently.
Never select `max` from this fallback; use it only when the captain has explicitly expressed that per-task or standing preference.

The supported launch-profile flags below are verified locally; each row records its evidence.

| Harness | Model flag | Effort flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude | `--model <model>` | `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>` | Verified on Claude Code 2.1.196. |

The concrete `harness` field owns adapter identity independently of the model provider.

### Model support discovery

Treat model and provider knowledge as current source-of-truth discovery, not as a permanent namespace or provider mapping.
Use the discovery surface in the current authenticated environment because supported and available models can change by version, account, and configuration.

| Harness | Authoritative discovery surface |
|---|---|
| claude | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker; `claude --help` documents the accepted alias or full-model-name input shape. |

For an unfamiliar harness or model namespace, establish support and provider identity from that harness's authoritative CLI help, model listing, or current documentation rather than guessing from a name or prefix.
A listing that reaches the account and does not contain the model is concrete evidence the model is unsupported: block that candidate and quote the result.
A discovery surface you could not reach establishes nothing; report that as uncertainty rather than turning it into a supported or unsupported verdict.

When a requested effort value is outside the harness-specific accepted set, `fm-spawn` records the requested `effort=` in meta but emits no effort flag for that harness.
This preserves launch success instead of passing a known-bad value.

## no-mistakes skill invocation

Send the validation skill using the target harness's skill invocation form.
Natural language is acceptable if uncertain.

- claude: `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes`.

## Submission acknowledgement hazards

A send or key action reporting success is not proof that the intended action happened.
A TUI can accept and queue an Enter while leaving text visible, consume Enter in a slash popup without submitting, or silently drop a message sent before readiness even though the send returns success.
The shared symptom is a healthy-looking pane with no work in progress, so every adapter must verify the observable postcondition specific to its TUI.

## claude (VERIFIED; busy-state hooks live-verified 2026-07-28 on Claude Code 2.1.220)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | Owned lifecycle hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` opens a turn, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd` close it. Claude fires no hook for a manual interrupt, so a firstmate-initiated interrupt must record the clear itself. |
| Exit command | `/exit` |
| Interrupt | single Escape |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>` (e.g. `/no-mistakes`) |

First launch in a fresh worktree, or first ever on a machine, may show a trust or bypass-permissions confirmation.
After every spawn, peek the pane within about 20 seconds.
If such a dialog is showing, accept it from an active firstmate session using `FM_HOME=<this-firstmate-home> bin/fm-send.sh <window> --key Enter`, or the choice the dialog requires, unless `FM_HOME` is already set to the active firstmate home; verify the brief started processing.

Claude renders a predicted-next-prompt suggestion as dim/faint text inside an otherwise-empty composer after a turn completes.
A plain `tmux capture-pane` cannot tell that ghost text apart from typed text.
Firstmate launches every claude crewmate with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false`, scoped to firstmate-launched agents through `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, so it never touches the captain's global config.
The CLI's `--prompt-suggestions` flag is print/SDK-mode only and does not suppress the interactive composer ghost text, verified empirically on v2.1.186.
As defense in depth for any pane that flag cannot reach, including the captain's own firstmate composer that away-mode reads, the shared `fm_composer_strip_ghost` extractor in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` removes dim/faint SGR 2 ghost runs before pending-input classification on every ANSI-capable reader.
Its broader dark-TRUECOLOR placeholder handling and dark-theme tradeoff have active captures in `docs/verification/runtime-backends.md`.
That styled capture is internal to the boolean detector only.
`fm-peek` and every other human or LLM-facing capture path stays plain `tmux capture-pane` with no escape codes.

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-04, Claude Code 2.1.201; preserved 2026-07-08, Claude Code 2.1.204; Stop-owned auto-arm revalidated 2026-07-24, Claude Code 2.1.219).**
This is separate from the per-task crewmate turn-end hook above (that one just `touch`es a marker file in a task's own `.claude/settings.local.json`).
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.claude/settings.json` registers two Stop hooks: `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude` and the Stop-owned auto-arm `bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh` (`asyncRewake: true`, `timeout: 28800`), and exiting the guard with status 2 plus stderr reliably forces the model to continue.
Claude Code's stdin payload to a Stop hook carries a `stop_hook_active` boolean that is `true` when the current stop attempt follows ANY stop-hook-driven continuation, including `asyncRewake` rewakes; the primary guard therefore ignores it in `--claude` mode and uses the cooperative claim/epoch check plus a bounded re-block budget instead, while the default mode still treats it as a one-block loop guard.
A project-level `.claude/settings.json` only takes effect when Claude Code's project root is that exact directory - it does not walk up from a subdirectory looking for one, so firstmate launches the primary from the repo root.
After those settings are loaded, hook command resolution is still cwd-sensitive because Claude Code runs commands through `/bin/sh` against the session's current cwd; keep the tracked commands anchored through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/...` and see `docs/turnend-guard.md` for the verified Stop-hook details.
Claude Code's primary watcher protocol is Stop-owned: the auto-arm hook fires on every Stop and foregrounds `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` when the home is eligible and still needs supervision, and its exit-2 `asyncRewake` rewake is the wake; the model drains and handles wakes but never runs a routine re-arm command.
