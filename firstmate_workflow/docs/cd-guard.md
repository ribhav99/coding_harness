# cd-guard PreToolUse seatbelt

This document is the authoritative human-readable contract for the cd-guard PreToolUse seatbelt.
`bin/fm-cd-command-policy.mjs` is the single decision owner.
`bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh` is the stable harness transport, primary-checkout scope, and output renderer.
The tracked harness adapters forward command text without classifying it.

It is the third member of a family of primary-session guards that share the same cross-harness hook machinery:
the watcher-arm PreToolUse seatbelt (`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`, `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`) and the turn-end supervision guard (`bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`, `docs/turnend-guard.md`).

## Purpose and boundary

The primary firstmate shell persists its working directory across tool calls.
A stray persistent top-level `cd projects/<clone>` therefore silently relocates the shell, so the next firstmate-owned command - a backlog write, an `fm-*` lifecycle call, `tasks-axi` - runs inside a project clone instead of the home.
That has actually happened: a persistent top-level `cd` caused a firstmate-owned backlog write to execute inside a project clone rather than the home.
The seatbelt denies exactly that command shape - a cwd change that persists to the primary shell - before it runs.

This guard is not a general sandbox.
It classifies shell command positions only; it never evaluates, expands, sources, or runs any byte of the submitted command.
Its threat model is agent mistakes, the same as the watcher-arm seatbelt: an accidental bare `cd projects/foo`, not a deliberately obfuscated bypass.

## Scope: plain firstmate checkouts only

The guard fires only in a plain firstmate checkout where git-dir equals git-common-dir.
It is a silent no-op (exit 0, no output) everywhere else, so it never interferes with a crewmate or scout that legitimately works inside its own project or firstmate task worktree.

`bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh` owns its checkout detection; the turn-end guard's marker-aware scope is a separate contract (`docs/turnend-guard.md`).
A plain, non-worktree checkout has `git rev-parse --git-dir` equal to `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.
A crewmate or scout task worktree - the shape `bin/fm-spawn.sh` always hands out - is a linked git worktree where the two differ, so the guard is inert there.
The checkout must also carry `AGENTS.md` and `bin/`, and any failure to confirm the primary is treated as inert, never as a block.

## Block vs allow

The discriminator is persistence to the parent shell's cwd, not the mere presence of the token `cd`.

The guard **blocks** a `cd`, `pushd`, or `popd` builtin that runs in an executed top-level position in the parent shell, because such a command persistently changes the primary shell's own working directory.
This covers a bare `cd projects/foo`, `cd ..`, `cd`, `cd -`, an absolute `cd /some/path` (still a persistent relocation of the parent shell), `pushd <dir>`, `popd`, a leading-assignment form such as `X=1 cd foo`, quoted or escaped command-word fragments that cook to a bare builtin, and any list form where the builtin runs in the parent shell (`cd x && cmd`, `cmd; cd x`, `cmd || cd x`, `command cd x`, `command -p cd x`, `command -- cd x`, `builtin cd x`, `command builtin cd x`, `cd x >/dev/null`, and newline-separated lists).

The guard **allows** everything else, including these safe scoped forms that must never be blocked:

- A command that reaches a target without changing the shell's own cwd: `git -C <dir> ...`, `make -C <dir> ...`, or an absolute path on the command itself.
- A directory change that does not persist to the parent shell: a subshell `(cd x && ...)`, a `bash -c 'cd ...'` / `sh -c` / `zsh -c` payload, an `env -C <dir> ...`, a `find ... -execdir` runner, a pipeline stage (`cd x | cmd`), or a backgrounded `cd x &`.
- A `cd` behind a forking or exec'ing wrapper (`env`, `sudo`, `nohup`, `timeout`, `gtimeout`, `exec`), which runs in a child and never persists (and generally just fails, since `cd` is a builtin with no external program).
- A path-qualified external command named `cd`, `command`, or `builtin`, such as `./cd`, `/usr/bin/cd`, `./command`, `/usr/bin/command`, or `./builtin`, because it runs as a child process and cannot change the parent shell's cwd.
- A `command` query such as `command -v cd`, `command -V cd`, or a clustered form such as `command -pv cd`, because it reports command resolution without executing the named builtin.
- The token `cd` appearing as data: quoted text (`echo "cd projects/foo"`), a comment, a substring of another word (`cdk`, `abcd`, `record`), a `printf` payload, or any later argument word.

An absolute-path `cd` is blocked on purpose: the ALLOW carve-out for absolute paths is for commands that address a target by absolute path, not for `cd`, which relocates the shell itself regardless of whether its argument is relative or absolute.
Blocking a top-level `cd` is safe in the strong sense: the guard's steady state is "always at the home", so a return-to-home `cd` is redundant rather than necessary, and the block never causes a wrong-directory write.

### Accepted non-goals

Consistent with the agent-mistake threat model, the guard deliberately does not chase every obfuscated bypass:

- A `cd` reconstructed by a command substitution (`$(echo c)d x`) or hidden inside a brace group (`{ cd x; }`) is not blocked. Brace-group recursion is avoided because this classifier cannot reliably tell a brace group `{ cd; }` from brace expansion `{cd,foo}`, and a false block there is worse than the missed exotic bypass.
- Malformed or untokenizable syntax fails open (allow). Unlike the watcher-arm seatbelt, which fails closed on unclassifiable protected commands, the cd-guard prioritizes zero false blocks over catching a malformed bypass, because a blocked backlog write is a correctness hazard while a missed exotic `cd` is only the pre-existing status quo.

If a genuinely ambiguous command shape is found that risks a false block, the guard is not extended by guesswork; the ambiguity is escalated and the guard stays precise rather than over-eager.

## Stable reason code

Every deny carries one stable code in square brackets before its prose reason.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `persistent-cd` | A top-level `cd`/`pushd`/`popd` would persistently change the primary shell's own working directory. |

The reason directs the caller to reach the target without moving the shell by using `git -C <dir>`, placing an absolute path on the intended command itself, or scoping the `cd` to a subshell.
It does not permit `cd /home/project`, because an absolute-path `cd` remains a persistent directory change and is denied.

## Transport and fail-open behavior

- Claude sends stdin JSON at `.tool_input.command` and adds `--claude` to preserve Claude's stderr-only deny requirement.

Processing order is cheapest-first: a strict-superset prefilter, then the primary-checkout scope, then the Node policy owner.
The prefilter removes ordinary single quotes, double quotes, backslashes, carriage returns, and newlines before fast-allowing any command that carries no `cd`, `pushd`, or `popd` substring and no quoting-decoder marker (`$'` ANSI-C or `$"` locale), so quoted or escaped command-word fragments delegate to the policy while most commands never pay for the git scoping calls or the Node process.
The quoting-decoder marker set is coupled to the classifier's decoder set in `bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs`: adding any new quote or expansion form the classifier decodes requires extending the prefilter marker set in the same change, or it stops being a strict superset.

Empty stdin, unparseable JSON, missing `jq` on the stdin path, missing Node, a missing policy owner, or an invalid policy response all fail open with exit 0 and no output.
A broken hook must never deny every shell tool call.

## Output contract

Identical in shape to `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`:

- Allow (and inert-outside-primary) returns exit 0 with both streams empty.
- Deny returns exit 2 and writes `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny"},"systemMessage":"[persistent-cd] reason"}` to stderr.
- `--claude` suppresses stdout completely because Claude ignores a PreToolUse deny when stdout is nonempty.

## Shared classifier ownership

`bin/fm-cd-command-policy.mjs` imports the shell tokenizer and command-position analysis (`Lexer`, `splitProgram`, `commandPosition`) from `bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs`, the sole owner of firstmate's shell classification.
`basename` remains a private helper of the shared arm classifier because the cd policy identifies shell builtins by exact cooked-word identity.
The cd-guard never duplicates shell lexing; it adds only the cd-specific decision on top of that shared classifier.
`bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs` runs its own CLI entry point only when invoked directly, never on import, so the two policies stay independent CLIs over one parser.

## Harness wiring

| Harness | Entry | Adapter behavior on checker exit 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse Bash hook forwarding stdin with `--claude` | Blocks the tool call; stderr deny object, stdout empty. |
| Pi | `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` `tool_call` handler | Returns `{block: true}`; piggybacks on the already-loaded primary extension so no extra `-e` flag is needed. |

Each harness runs the cd-guard alongside the watcher-arm seatbelt; the two are independent checks, and either deny blocks the command.

## Automated validation

`tests/fm-cd-pretool-check.test.sh` owns the acceptance matrix.

Run:

```sh
bash -n bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh
shellcheck bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh tests/fm-cd-pretool-check.test.sh
node --check bin/fm-cd-command-policy.mjs
node --check bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs
tests/fm-cd-pretool-check.test.sh
tests/fm-arm-pretool-check.test.sh
```

## Live validation record, 2026-07-11

Each harness ran against a scratch primary-shaped firstmate checkout: a plain git repo with `AGENTS.md`, `bin/` holding the real `fm-cd-pretool-check.sh`, `fm-cd-command-policy.mjs`, and `fm-arm-command-policy.mjs` plus a no-op dummy `fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`, a `projects/foo/` stand-in clone, and the tracked harness hook config.
No live watcher, fleet state, or the captain's real primary checkout was involved.
Each harness was told to run, as separate tool calls, a top-level `cd projects/foo && touch <abs>/BLOCKED` (must be denied) and a subshell `(cd projects/foo && touch <abs>/ALLOWED)` (must run), with the sentinel files as the observable.

Harness versions and outcomes:

- **Claude Code 2.1.207** - blocked. Claude reported the top-level command "denied by the `PreToolUse` hook (`fm-cd-pretool-check.sh`)", the `BLOCKED` sentinel was absent, and the subshell form was permitted to run. A prior control `touch` proved the harness executed commands.
- **Pi 0.80.6** - blocked. The `BLOCKED` sentinel was absent while the subshell `ALLOWED` sentinel was created; that differential (top-level denied, subshell run, in the same session) can only come from the guard.

The launch commands mirrored `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`'s validation:

```sh
claude -p "$PROMPT" --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format text
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts --no-context-files --no-session "$PROMPT"
```
