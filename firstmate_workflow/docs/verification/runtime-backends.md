# Runtime backend verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record contains reusable version-scoped evidence for active runtime guarantees.
The backend guides own current setup, safety boundaries, and limitations.
Exact task chronology, branch names, temporary homes, local paths, process ids, thread ids, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## tmux

Foreground-process behavior was verified on 2026-07-07 with tmux 3.6a on macOS.

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s fmtest -n testwin
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin 'sleep 30' Enter
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin C-c
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
```

Observed output:

```text
zsh
sleep
zsh
```

A persistent parent shell waiting for a child remained reported as the parent process, while a shell that directly execed a simple command changed identity with the process itself.

Installed-wrapper checks:

```sh
pi --version
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
0.82.0
0.82.0
```

The isolated process and endpoint checks used:

```sh
tmux display-message -p -t "$target" '#{pane_current_command}'
ps -o comm= -p "$wrapper_pid"
ps -o comm= -p "$engine_pid"
FM_HOME="$fixture_home" bin/fm-crew-state.sh "$task_id"
```

Observed bounded shapes:

```text
pi-launcher
.../Pi Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/pi/pi
state: done ...
```

Both launches executed a submitted tool instruction and touched the generated `turn_end` marker.
That shared plain-Pi path is retained as disconfirming evidence against using ancestry as runtime-selection authority.
Firstmate therefore sets the exact `FM_PI_HARNESS` selection marker on both worker launch paths, while an unmarked Pi-family process remains `pi`.
Both recorded runtime identities now classify the exact `pi-launcher` foreground command as `alive`.

Backend applicability was reviewed across every spawn adapter.

```sh
tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh
tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh
```

Expected structural matrix: real text on any content row is pending; all-empty complete boxes are empty; unreadable, incomplete, or unsafe boxes are unknown; and non-bordered panes retain cursor-row compatibility.
Expected submit matrix: proven pending plus busy is accepted as queued; proven pending plus idle remains pending; ambiguous pending is never converted by the busy exception; and only a proven empty composer succeeds directly.

### Cleanup endpoint identity

The cleanup identity boundary was validated on 2026-07-28 with tmux 3.6a and metadata fixtures for every supported backend.

```sh
tests/fm-teardown-endpoint-safety.test.sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
```

Bounded output from the incident regression:

```text
ok - fm-teardown: missing, empty, malformed, ambiguous, and task-mismatched endpoints refuse before every mutation or runtime call
ok - tmux backend: direct empty target returns nonzero without invoking tmux
ok - process cleanup: creation-time PID identity removes only the exact child and preserves the control child
ok - fm-teardown: dedicated-socket invalid cleanup preserves target/control and valid cleanup removes only the exact target
```

The dedicated tmux cell removed ambient tmux variables, required a socket-bound wrapper, kept one target and one independent control window, and proved the wrapper was not called for invalid metadata or a direct empty target.
Valid cleanup removed only the exact task-bound target and left the control window live.
