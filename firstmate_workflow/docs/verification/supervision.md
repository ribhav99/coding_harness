# Supervision integration verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record supports current session-start, turn-end, watcher-continuity, and wedge-alarm guarantees.
Operator behavior and active limits remain in the linked current guides.
Task-specific chronology, temporary paths, run identifiers, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## Native session-start delivery

```sh
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

```sh
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.

This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
The earlier `sendUserMessage` counterfactual raced the positional prompt; the current non-triggering `pi.sendMessage` custom message did not.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#tmux) owns the shared-ancestry evidence and authoritative selection-marker boundary.

Current deterministic and live entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Marked current operational input and the two exact legacy compatibility shapes selected Bearings, while genuine near-miss captain messages remained real boundaries.
The detailed reconciliation and task chronology stay in the private audit report and PR evidence.

## Semantic busy state

The per-adapter semantic sources behind [`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`](../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) were live-verified on 2026-07-28 against firstmate-launched workers wired exactly as `fm-spawn` writes them.
Each pass polled `state/<id>.busy-state` while a real turn ran.

| Harness | Version verified | Semantic source | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | Extension `agent_start` / `agent_settled` with `ctx.isIdle()` | The spawn seed `busy source=fm-spawn`, then `busy source=pi-ext event=agent-start`, then `idle source=pi-ext event=agent-settled`; the turn-end marker was still touched. |
| Claude | 2.1.220 (Claude Code) | Hooks `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, `SessionEnd` | `UserPromptSubmit` fired for the argv launch prompt and each steer, and `Stop` closed every completed turn. A mid-stream Escape interrupt fired no closing hook, which is why the firstmate-controlled clear exists. `StopFailure` and `SessionEnd` are wired from the four hook names present in the installed binary; only the abnormal paths they cover were not reproduced live. |

```sh
```

The app-server protocol schema does define the required lifecycle (`turn/started`, plus a `turn/completed` status of `completed`, `interrupted`, `failed`, or `inProgress`), so the gate is a reachability problem rather than a protocol gap.

Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-busy-state.test.sh
tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh
tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh
```

## Turn-end guard

The direct and passive mechanisms were validated across all five harnesses on 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-12, with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.219 | Cooperative blocking `Stop` guard plus `asyncRewake` auto-arm | A fresh unsupervised session ran session start first, reclaimed a stale dead-owner lock, completed two tokenless rewake cycles with no model arm command or guard continuation, and left a competing live owner unchanged. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |

```sh
FM_GROK_STOP_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  FM_GROK_NATIVE_BIN="$native_grok_0_2_112" \
  FM_GROK_LEGACY_BIN="$official_pre_native_grok_0_2_73" \
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
```

The same run proved the Claude-compatible Stop entries stay inert under `GROK_AGENT`, the legacy resume carries `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1`, and every replacement root is removed after exact target cleanup while its control window survives.

On 2026-07-28 with Claude Code 2.1.205, `fm_harness_ancestry_pid()` in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` was fixed to resolve the outermost pid of a contiguous nested-harness run instead of the first match, so the Stop auto-arm correctly reaches the session's true lock owner through Claude Code's multi-level `bg-spare` hook worker chain.

The Claude product live path ran with Claude Code 2.1.219 on 2026-07-24:

```sh
claude --version
FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.219 (Claude Code)
ok - Claude 2.1.219 (Claude Code) live E2E reclaimed a stale session lock through session start, completed two tokenless Stop-owned rewake cycles, and preserved the competing-live-owner boundary
```

Current entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
tests/fm-supervision-instructions.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the 2026-07-17 live pass with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24, all against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```text
Claude Code 2.1.219
Pi 0.80.10
```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` | Session start reclaimed a stale owner before two Stop-owned cycles, and a competing live owner prevented arm, rewake, epoch write, or lock replacement. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-07-27 against the tracked extension with a faithful in-process factory rebind (module cache retained, real arm children):

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, the replacement generation armed again without a Pi restart and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.

Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh
tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh
tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
```

## Wedge-alarm channels

Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

```sh
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
