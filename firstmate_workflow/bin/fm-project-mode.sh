# Resolve a project's delivery mode and yolo flag from the data/projects.md registry.
# Prints two words to stdout: "<mode> <yolo>" where mode is one of
# no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only and yolo is on|off.
#
# Registry line format (data/projects.md):
#   - <name> - <desc> (added <date>)                  -> direct-PR off  (legacy default; was no-mistakes upstream)
#   - <name> [<mode>] - <desc> (added <date>)          -> <mode> off
#   - <name> [<mode> +yolo] - <desc> (added <date>)    -> <mode> on
#
# mode = how a finished change reaches main:
#   no-mistakes  full pipeline -> PR -> captain merge (default)
#   direct-PR    push + PR via gh-axi, no pipeline -> captain merge
#   local-only   local branch, no remote/PR -> captain approve -> guarded local merge
# yolo (orthogonal) = when on, firstmate may make routine approval decisions itself.
#   AGENTS.md section 7 is the single owner of authority exceptions, including
#   ask-user contract expansion and stronger captain boundaries.
#
# LOCAL FORK: every fallback defaults to "direct-PR off", not "no-mistakes off".
# Upstream's intent is "a typo never silently drops the gate" - fail toward MORE
# rigor. In this fork no-mistakes is not installed at all, so falling back to it
# would route work into a pipeline that does not exist. Here the gate IS
# direct-PR plus the reviewer fleet in ../skills/coding/, which makes direct-PR
# the correct fail-safe. Applies to the legacy bracket-less registry line, an
# unregistered project, and an unknown mode. See FORK-NOTES.md.
#
# An unknown/missing project or unknown mode falls back to "direct-PR off" and warns
# to stderr, so a typo never silently drops the gate.
# Usage: fm-project-mode.sh <project-name>
